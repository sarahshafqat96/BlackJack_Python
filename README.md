# INTRODUCTION
Blackjack, also known as 21, is one of the most popular card games worldwide. Played between one or more players and a dealer, the objective of blackjack is to beat the dealer's hand without exceeding a total of 21 points. Each card has a value: face cards are worth 10 points, aces can be worth either 1 or 11 points, and all other cards are worth their numerical value. Players are dealt two cards initially and can choose to "hit" (take additional cards) or "stand" (keep their current hand). The dealer also receives two cards, with one card face up. My version of game has one player and one dealer
